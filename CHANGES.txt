0.3.5 (Mar 2024)
==================

nomogen.py:
- speed improvements
  use library & vector calculations, calculate derivatives using differentiation matrix
  remove some unused variables & code
- add dual scale support
- add muShape
  this option frees the outer axes from being ties to the corners of the
  nomogram area
- replace pdegree with npoints
  this describes the ideas better.  old pdegree is still (quietly) suported.
- improved comments and coding
- enable even numbers of points for chebyshev interpolation
- improve axis tic_side logic
- footer text width is wide as the page, text centred
- other minor nomogen coding efficiencies & updates
- derivative uses Fornberg's method, so should work with python 3.12

examples:
- new exampless
   these illustrate dual scales &
   nomogen's ability to create nomograms from difficult equations
- shebang changed to #!/usr/bin/env python3
- xxx_scales renamed -> xxx_axis
- pdegree renamed npoints
- hiking and piedra reflect new dual scales method
- some examples use the muShape option
- some examples use "from math import *" to simplify using maths functions
- pendulum example has extended range, uses custom ticks, larger page size (A4)
- other tweaks, eg change NN resulting from enabling of even numbered values

- much expanded documents

0.3.4 (March 2023)
==================
- nomogen updates
- correction to affine-transformation algorithm for aligning axes (or blocks)


x.x.x (Jul 2022)
=====
- Added nomogen, a program that auto generates nomograms from a formula

0.3.3
=====
- Bux fixes based on pull-requests
- Cleanup

0.3.2
=====
- Fix of bug with numpy astype() behavior change with arrays

0.3.1
=====
- compatibility with python 3.7

0.3.0
=====
- double alignment
- python3 compatibility
- minor code style cleanup
- main repo of code moved to github
- documentation in github: pynomo-doc

0.2.2
=====
- new scale (smart) scale types: 'smart linear', 'smart log'
- isopleths easily defined
- default number formatting ('text_format') is %4.4g


0.2.1
=====
- small bug fixes
- negative values in linear axis sometimes caused errors (e.g. -30...400), now corrected.
- colors
- axis with arrow markings
- R titles over pivot lines can be set manually
- Extra titles for axes
- option to print grid for text placement
- brute force manual line drawing (for isopleths)
- pre_func to draw with pyx primitives under nomograph
- post_func to draw with pyx primitives over nomograph

0.2.0b0
=======
Totally new approach.


0.1.0b1
=======
Added functionality
-------------------
- axis title position can be tuned
- log axis
- two more examples
- title box added
- default values for "functions" (nomogram definition) added


0.1.0a1
=======
Three basic nomograms (three variable)
--------------------------------------
	* three parallel lines 'F2(v)=F1(u)+F3(w)'
	* N nomograph 'F2(v)=F1(u)*F3(w)'
	* general determinant
              -------------------------
              | f1(u) | g1(u) | h1(u) |
              -------------------------
              | f2(v) | g2(v) | h2(v) | = 0
              -------------------------
              | f3(w) | g3(w) | h3(w) |
              -------------------------

In general
----------
First distribution
